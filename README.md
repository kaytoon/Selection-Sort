# Selection-Sort

Selection sort starts by scanning the entire given list to find its smallest element and exchange it with the first element, putting the smallest element in its final position in the sorted list. Then we scan the list, starting with the second element, to find the smallest among the last n âˆ’ 1 elements and exchange it with the second element, putting the second smallest element in its final position.

The analysis of selection sort is straightforward. The input size is given by the number of elements n; the basic operation is the key comparison A[j ] < A[min]. The number of times it is executed depends only on the array size.

To see the algorithm is full action, see the attached programmed.
